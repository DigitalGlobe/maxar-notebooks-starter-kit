    "This tutorial covers using SWIR imagery for creating spectral indices. SWIR stands for **S**hort **W**avelength **I**nfra**R**ed and represents an additional swath of spectrum that can be used for analyzing satellite imagery. The use of the SWIR band is not necessarily more complicated than other bands when creating spectral indices, but accessing SWIR imagery can be.  Instead of using the imagery tab to the left of the notebook, you'll need to directly query the GBDX API to find and order SWIR imagery.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we'll need to look for Worldview-3 (WV03_SWIR) images since it is the DigitalGlobe satellite which has a SWIR sensor to generate the imagery we need for our analysis.  In addition to identifying the appopriate sensor and satellite we'll also need to find an AOI.  To create an AOI we can use the imagery tab to generate a bounding box that can be cut and pasted for our code below. In addition to our SWIR search we will also look for VNIR (**V**ery **N**ear **I**nfra**R**ed) since several spectral indices require bands from both image products."

    "We can see that the VNIR data is part of the visibile spectrum imagery product, which is in color and at a higher resolution that the black and white SWIR image.  The SWIR band in the imagery is not part of the visible spectrum of light - it falls between about 1400 and 3000 nanometers in wavelength.  This is why it doesn't show up in color and it accentuates shadow and contrast in the image.  This is also what makes SWIR particularily good for feature identification.  The second visible difference is the lower resolution (fuzziness) of the SWIR image.  This is because the SWIR imagery is captured with a different sensors on Worldview-3 that operate with a resolution of 3.7/7.5 meters.  The sensors that capture VNIR operate up to 1.2 meter in resolution.  \n",

Since our proposed index uses data from the two different imagery products we've highlighted; it presents a data problem for our analysis.  The VNIR and SWIR data are at different resolutions, so we need to normalize them before we can perform band math to create our spectral index.  To begin our normalization process we need to see what the pixel size difference is between our two images.  We can use the Python .shape command to get the relative sizes of our VNIR and SWIR images."

To do so we first need to decide which bands we want to use for our index and declare them.
